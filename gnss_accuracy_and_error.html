<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>A Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), also commonly called a
Global Positioning System (GPS) which is actually a brand of GNSS, is a
relatively easy and affordable way to georeference points.
Georeferencing is the process of associating points on the surface of
the Earth to a standardized coordinate system. This allows us to say the
Eiffel Tower is located at 29.9792° N, 31.1342° E using the WGS 84
geographic coordinate system. This is typically just referred to as a
latitude and longitude without any thought to what geographic coordinate
system we are using. While lat/long coordinates can be <a
href="https://xkcd.com/2170/">extremely precise</a> the question this
resource aims to explore is how <em>accurate</em> are GNSS recording
devices and what impacts their accuracy.</p>
<p>As we are focusing on <strong>accuracy</strong>, let’s clarify the
difference between <strong>accuracy</strong> and
<strong>precision</strong>:</p>

<p>Here’s an <a href="https://xkcd.com/2696/">alternative definition
example</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="outline" class="section level2">
<h2>Outline</h2>
<p>This resource analyses through exploration the accuracy and error of
location data collected along a walk through Belval, Luxembourg, using a
GNSS device (Crosscall Trekker-M1 Core).</p>
</div>
<div id="a-brief-explanation-of-gnss" class="section level2">
<h2>A brief explanation of GNSS</h2>
<p>GNSS sensors or devices capture signals from satellites and sometimes
base stations to determine their location. The satellites orbit at a
distance roughly 20,000 km from the surface of the Earth. The American
GPS system with its constellation of satellites was the first GNSS.
There are now other GNSS satellite constellations: China’s BeiDou (35
satellites), the EU’s Galileo (24+ satellites), Russia’s GLONASS (24+
satellites), India’s IRNSS (7 satellites), and Japan’s QZSS (7
satellites by 2023).</p>
<p>Some GNSS systems complement existing offers to improve regional
sensing (e.g. Japan’s QZSS), while others can function independently.
Different GNSS sensors can detect different and multiple satellite
constellations. While having much more than 10 satellites ‘visible’ by
the GNSS sensor makes little difference, it’s their position that
matters more. For this reason, while 20 satellite signals may be sensed
by a device, a selection process takes place to optimize which will be
used or locked, to calculate a location. Therefore having more
satellites available is only beneficial in that it allows the optimizing
satellite selection.</p>
<p>Determining the location of the GNSS receiver uses a process called
trilateration. This involves determining the distance from multiple
objects, in this case satellites. As mentioned, their position will
determine the possible error. Distance is determined by very precise
clocks in the satellites, broadcasting the time they send out a signal,
which is used to calculate the travel time to the receiver.</p>
<p>Below demonstrates an extremely simplified illustration of how
satellite angle relative to the receiver and one another will create
varying shapes and sizes of error. In this illustration the areas where
the circles overlap is the size of the uncertainty. The left frame
illustrates what happens when satellites are low on the horizon, versus
on the middle frame, when one is at the azimuth and the horizon, and
finally the right frame when two satellites are overhead.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/gnss_error.svg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><strong>Figure 1: Satellite configurations and the
resulting shapes and areas of inaccuracy.</strong></p>
</div>
<p>With this basic introduction to how GNSS receivers determine location
and satellite location can impact this, we will take a look at some
actual data to see how it varies relative to actual locations. Due to
how GNSS receivers operate many other factors can influence their
accuracy.</p>
</div>
<div id="a-walked-path" class="section level2">
<h2>A walked path</h2>
<p>Below is a walked tour through and in the vicinity of Belval
(Luxembourg), starting in the east next to the furnaces, going along the
shopping centre, then around the Park to the west and returning, ending
in front of LISER’s and the University of Luxembourg’s Maison des
Sciences Humaines (Social Sciences building).</p>
<p>Note that the walked path starts and ends in an urban area with tall
structures, with some travel through open spaces.</p>
<p>While a smartphone and app was used to record location, the app uses
NMEA data which is not the same as typically using smartphone location
data. Smartphones apps, such as Google Maps or Navigation, typically use
other or additional means to estimate location that consume less battery
power: - proximity to cellular towers - proximity to Wi-Fi hotspots</p>
<p>Requirements for needed accuracy and availability of the above
alternatives obviously determine whether GNSS processing will be used to
provide accurate geolocation.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="maps/BelvalWalk_trace.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><strong>Figure 2: Trace of walked path.</strong></p>
</div>
<p>The above figure illustrates the route walked (green line) which was
manually digitized using QGIS. This will serve to compare and evaluate
the recorded or sensed GNSS location.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-sensed-path---gnss-data" class="section level2">
<h2>The sensed path - GNSS data</h2>
<p>GNSS devices decode satellite signals to determine their location.
The signals contain three data parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>A unique identifier (the spacecraft vehicle number - SVN)</li>
<li>The time the signal was sent</li>
<li>The implicit location of the satellite (the orbit/ephemeris and
location on it - sort of)</li>
</ul>
<p>The decoding process locates, with some error, the device’s location
and elevation relative to the Earth’s sea-level equivalent by
determining the satellites distances (the trilateration process). This
decoding process creates a diversity of data, such as device location
(lat/long), elevation, and various error measures, among others.</p>
<p>This generated data, in its raw form, is called NMEA data after the
organization that defined the standard, the National Marine Electronics
Association. There are different versions of the standard. Rather than
nicely structured, NMEA data can be quite messy or corrupted and needs
further refinement before being easily usable. Many devices and data
analysis tools will process the NMEA data for you so that it is already
comprehensible in data or visual form.</p>

<p><strong>Code snippet 1: Some NMEA data sentences.</strong></p>
<p>We captured the NMEA sentences with an Android smartphone App called
NMEA Tools Version 2.7.35. The NMEA data was <a
href="processing/extract_nmea_data.py">processed using a Python script
to extract</a> the lat/long points and other data. Depending on your
device multiple GNSS constellations may be captured.</p>
<p>Besides lat/long data, NMEA data also contains: - Relative angles of
GNSS satellites visible/detected - Satellites used to determine the
sensor’s location - Error of the location measurement - Movement speed
and bearing/direction</p>
<p>In the figure below the lat/long points are added to the map of the
walked path.</p>
<p>Note that point data can as easily be mapped or graphed as lines as
well as points. While using lines is beneficial in showing continuity,
sequence, or direction, lines can also obscure points that communicate
information, such as the accuracy of data (a straight line can either
mean a straight path or missing data) or changes in speed (the
difference in distance between points recorded at regular time
intervals).</p>
<p>The maps and figures will show point and line data as
appropriate.</p>

<p class="caption"><strong>Figure 3: Overlay of GNSS sensed path over
walked path.</strong></p>
</div>
<p>In the figure above we see the device-sensed path data following
closely the taken path in the western area, but less so in the
south-eastern half where more buildings are present.</p>
<p>Temporally, in the graph below, we can see that there is a lot of
deviation from the taken path at the start and end of the walk.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 4: Plot of distance error between traced and sensed
paths over time.</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="what-causes-error" class="section level2">
<h2>What causes error?</h2>
<p>Since GNSS accuracy depends on receiving satellite signals,
interference between the sensor and the signals will increase error.
Buildings are a common cause of location error, but weather, forests,
the atmosphere, and topography can also degrade, refract, reflect, or
block satellite signals, reducing the location accuracy.</p>
<p><img src="gnss_accuracy_and_error_files/figure-html/satcount%20along%20route-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 5: The error and number of satellites used to locate
the sensor.</strong></p>
<p>It appears that the number of satellite signals received decreases at
times of higher error. This can be misleading however, as a received
signal can still be delayed and/or reflected. So this may not be an
effective means of measuring (in)accuracy.</p>
<p>As buildings interfere with GNSS precision let’s <a

<p>Rather than explore this visually, we can view this graphically by
comparing surrounding building heights with error. Below, the mean
building heights within 50m of each recorded location is graphed with
the error distance.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 6: Plot of surrounding building heights and error

<p>Clearly the distance between the known path and the sensed path,
increases according to average building heights, as expected.</p>
<p>High structures reduce the GNSS device accuracy.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-number-of-satellites" class="section level2">
<h2>The number of satellites</h2>
<p>As mentioned in the introduction, GPS, is the brand of the American
GNSS system. Other systems exists such as GLONASS (Russia), Baedou
(China), and Galileo (EU). As location accuracy is dependent on getting
good satellite reception in desirable configurations, clearly having
more satellites accessible can be beneficial. Some GNSS devices can
track multiple satellites types.</p>
<p><img src="images/20221027-Crosscall-nmea_satpaths_INV_GLN.png"

<p><strong>Figure 7: Sky plots of GLONASS (left) and GPS (right)
satellites in view while completing walk.</strong></p>
<p>While the East and West are perhaps reversed to expectations,
consider these plots as the views when you look up at the sky.</p>
</div>
<div id="dynamic-satellite-selection" class="section level2">
<h2>Dynamic satellite selection</h2>
<p>While many satellites may be detected by a GNSS device, only up to 12
are used to calculate location. Depending on satellite reception, and
optimal angles, the selection of used satellites to determine the
receiver’s location changes as the device and the satellites move over
time.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/sat_anim.gif" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><strong>Figure 8: The movement and selection of
satellites used during the Belval walk. The perspective here is
top-down, like looking at a map.</strong></p>
</div>
<p>We can observe if it’s possible to see a pattern in satellite
selection based on where the device is as it moves along the walk in the
video below.</p>

<p><strong>Video 1: A video of the walked and sensed paths synchronized

</div>
<div id="which-satellites-are-used" class="section level2">
<h2>Which satellites are used?</h2>
<p>With this device and for this walk both GPS and GLONASS satellites
were detected.</p>
<p>It’s possible to compare which types of satellites are more available
and also actually used for location determination.</p>
<p><img src="gnss_accuracy_and_error_files/figure-html/GLNvsGPS%20lock%20comparison-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 9: During the walk the GPS constellation provided
50-60% of the satellites with the remainder belonging to GLONASS.
Despite this about 80% of the satellites used to determine location were
from the GPS constellation with the remainder from GLONASS.</strong></p>
<p>This GNSS receiver uses GPS signals more than GLONASS. Why might this
be the case?</p>
</div>
<div id="dop-measures" class="section level2">
<h2>DOP measures</h2>
<p>We have spend lots of time comparing the sensed location to the
actual estimation of the travel path. Fortunately there may be an easier
way.</p>
<p>NMEA data contains Dilution of Precision (DOP) measures. There are
three: - Vertical DOP (1D) - Horizontal DOP (2D) - Position DOP (3D)</p>
<p>Lower DOP values are better. The values can range from under 1, which
are ideal, to over 20, being very poor. Dilution of precision integrates
the number and position of satellites to determine the likely accuracy
of the location measurement. These measures simply take into account
what we have already discussed, the number and relative position of
satellites and their signals to your GNSS sensor device.</p>
<p>Looking again at Figure 1, consider how different satellite positions
could impact DOP types differently.</p>
<p><img src="gnss_accuracy_and_error_files/figure-html/DOP%20measures-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 10: Different DOP values along the walk. DOP
fluctuations are higher when positional error is greater.</strong></p>
<p>Despite the DOP values in the figure above having just been labelled
as ‘good’, the figure above shows that small increases can quickly
augment the error distance (deviation).</p>
</div>
<div id="conclusion-on-gnss-accuracy-and-errors" class="section level2">
<h2>Conclusion on GNSS accuracy and errors</h2>
<p>We have explored a variety of error sources along a walked path. The
intent was to highlight the limits to GNSS accuracy and some of the
causes. In practice GNSS can be used to measure certain features with
non-trivial error, depending on the needs. Alternatives exist to improve
accuracy, such as differential GNSS, or pricier surveying equipment. But
for accurate, affordable, and independent (i.e., non-technical or system
dependent) low-tech solutions exist, such as using measuring tapes and
compasses combined with trigonometric operations.</p>
